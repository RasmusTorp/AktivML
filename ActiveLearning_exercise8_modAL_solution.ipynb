    "# Active Learning Using A Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is meant as an example of using an existing python framework to perform active learning. This could potentially make it easier to try many different algorithms and query strategies, as a coding structure for making it easy to replace parts is predefined, as well as implementations of common methods are given, but it requires that the user learns how to take advantage of the framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a word of caution, in case you find using the framework presented here confusing, for future work you might work be better off implementing the methods yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework that we will take a look at is the python package modAL ([github](https://github.com/modAL-python/modAL/tree/dev), [docs](https://modal-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)). You should go ahead and read the examples found on github, and if you feel adventurous, you can already take a look at the documentation too, where you can explore the implemented algorithms and how to add your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the installation details [here](https://github.com/modAL-python/modAL/tree/dev#installation), but it should simply be: \n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install modAL`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We give an example of implementating a Query-by-Committee algorithm using a pool-based scenario in the rest of this notebook going through these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Train a passive learner (random sampling from the pool) while evaluating its accuracy on a test set\n",
    "1. Create several committees of learners with a varying number of committee members\n",
    "1. Train these committees and evaluate accuracy on the test set\n",
    "1. Compare the learning curves between the passive learner and the different committees\n",
    "\n",
    "You should first read the implementation, try to change things, and run it to get an understand of how it all works. When you feel confident in using the code, you should do the exercise and compare the performances of the different methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Questions\n",
    "<font color=blue>\n",
    "How is the performance and computational complexity affected by the number of learners?<br>\n",
    "<font color=green>As the model has to be trained and evaluated on the entire pool for each of the committee members the complexity grows approximately linearly with the number of committee members. Fortunately, this can easily be done in parallel.<br>\n",
    "<font color=blue>Does the curve change in case another uncertainty sampling metric is used.<br>\n",
    "<font color=green>In this case we have more than one class so the different metrics may not lead to same samples being chosen (see the plot for three classes in the presentation), however in practice it appears that there is not much difference in this case.<br>\n",
    "<font color=blue>How are the active learners dependent on the amount of initial labeled data?<br>\n",
    "<font color=green>This is related to how well the model is able to make predictions about which points to include, when very few points are included initially the estimated uncertainty of samples to use can be very bad as the models are by no mean converged and therefore also produce \"strange\" uncertainty estimates. There is then a regime where there will be a benefit (of course still depending on the setting and presence of outliers etc.) where there will be a benefit, however in the other extreme where the model has already enough data is esstentially converged and it will make little or no difference what additional data is acquired.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<font color=blue>\n",
    "    \n",
    "If you have more time, you can also try to do the following:\n",
    "- Try to exchange the classification algorithm and rerun, choose for example the SVC and again induce randomness via bagging (bootstrap).<br>\n",
    "- Run on a different data set\n",
    "- Try different approaches to make the base learner differ (see ***the base model and randomness*** below)\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=black>\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "Be aware of these details of the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The base model and randomness**:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that different committee members/learners differ in their hypothesis/parameters, so we get a exploration of the version space. If the fitting algorithm is not inherently random, i.e., if given the same data it estimates identical parameters every time, the data should be resampled to fit the learners on different data. As you have seen, this can be done by using bagging.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below uses a [random forest classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#forest) as the base learner for the committee, which is an ensemble method using bagging already. You can take a look at the [parameters](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html) to control how different the models become. ***Hint***: The number of trees `n_estimators` is important for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also change the resampling to use bagging, and then use any learner you would like to try.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**required packages**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook uses the following packages to implement the example\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pandas : to store and evaluate the results\n",
    "- joblib (optional) : to speed up the experiment by running it parallel\n",
    "- tqdm : progress bar to keep track of run times.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note that it will take quite some time to run some of the code in particular for the larger committees. So equip yourself with patience and perhaps coffee and/or sweets ;)***"
